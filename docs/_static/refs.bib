  abstract  = "Functional magnetic resonance imaging in rodents holds great
               potential for advancing our understanding of brain networks.
               Unlike the human community, there remains no standardized
               resource in rodents for image processing, analysis and quality
               control, posing significant reproducibility limitations. Our
               software platform, Rodent Automated Bold Improvement of EPI
               Sequences, is a pipeline designed to address these limitations
               for preprocessing, quality control, and confound correction,
               along with best practices for reproducibility and transparency.
               We demonstrate the robustness of the preprocessing workflow by
               validating performance across multiple acquisition sites and
               both mouse and rat data. Building upon a thorough investigation
               into data quality metrics across acquisition sites, we introduce
               guidelines for the quality control of network analysis and offer
               recommendations for addressing issues. Taken together, this
               software platform will allow the emerging community to adopt
               reproducible practices and foster progress in translational
               neuroscience. There is a need for a standardized pipeline to
               process rodent fMRI images. Here, the authors present a platform
               for preprocessing, quality control and confound correction, and
               demonstrate its robustness across multiple sites and both mouse
               and rat data.",

              detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying
              spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important
              component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid
              in discriminating between related diseases, such as
              frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which
              manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we
              develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for
              maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of
              diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations
              necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful
              evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard,
              human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a
              related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation
              of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably
              with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the
              template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the
              correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings
              of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual
              rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested,
              SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with
              volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study
              indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method
              for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric
              MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.",

               commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is
               approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software
               library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image
               registration, segmentation and template building tools for
               quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to
               quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics
               on the affine and deformable components of a template-based
               normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three
               similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and
               faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We
               then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance
               on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain
               image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report
               evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both
               the affine and deformable components of the registration.
               Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with
               existing brain extraction results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical
               labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined
               with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best
               cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669$\pm$0.022).
               Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify
               the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups.
               Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance
               benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is
               the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to

              with magnetic resonance (MR) images with spatially varying noise
              levels (for both Gaussian and Rician distributed noise).
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: Most filtering techniques assume an equal
              noise distribution across the image. When this assumption is not
              met, the resulting filtering becomes suboptimal. This is the case
              of MR images with spatially varying noise levels, such as those
              obtained by parallel imaging (sensitivity-encoded), intensity
              inhomogeneity-corrected images, or surface coil-based
              acquisitions. We propose a new method where information regarding
              the local image noise level is used to adjust the amount of
              denoising strength of the filter. Such information is
              automatically obtained from the images using a new local noise
              estimation method. RESULTS: The proposed method was validated and
              compared with the standard nonlocal means filter on simulated and
              real MRI data showing an improved performance in all cases.
              CONCLUSION: The new noise-adaptive method was demonstrated to
              outperform the standard filter when spatially varying noise is
              present in the images.",

               statistical processes that are used to test hypotheses about
               regionally specific effects in neuroimaging data. The most
               established sorts of statistical parametric maps (e.g., Friston
               et al. (1991): J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 11:690-699; Worsley et
               al. 119921: J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 12:YOO-918) are based on
               linear models, for example ANCOVA, correlation coefficients and
               t tests. In the sense that these examples are all special cases
               of the general linear model it should be possible to implement
               them (and many others) within a unified framework. We present
               here a general approach that accommodates most forms of

               with fixed effects for factors, covariates and interaction of
               factors). This approach brings together two well established
               bodies of theory (the general linear model and the theory of
               Gaussian fields) to provide a complete and simple framework for
               the analysis of imaging data. The importance of this framework
               is twofold: (i) Conceptual and mathematical simplicity, in that
               the same small number of operational equations is used
               irrespective of the complexity of the experiment or nature of
               the statistical model and (ii) the generality of the framework

              motion covariates and band-pass filtering, performed sequentially
              and in a flexible order. In this article, we illustrate the
              shortcomings of this approach, as we show how later preprocessing
              steps can reintroduce artifacts previously removed from the data
              in prior preprocessing steps. We show that each regression step
              is a geometric projection of data onto a subspace, and that
              performing a sequence of projections can move the data into
              subspaces no longer orthogonal to those previously removed,
              reintroducing signal related to nuisance covariates. Thus, linear
              filtering operations are not commutative, and the order in which
              the preprocessing steps are performed is critical. These issues
              can arise in practice when any combination of standard

              illustrate the problem both theoretically and empirically through
              application to a test-retest rs-fMRI data set, and suggest
              remedies. These include (a) combining all steps into a single

              ringing artifacts that emanate from sharp transitions in signal

              temporal filtering before deleting contaminated volumes-in

              forwards in time, but deleting only the originally contaminated

              find that motion-induced signal changes (1) are often complex and
              variable waveforms, (2) are often shared across nearly all brain
              voxels, and (3) often persist more than 10s after motion ceases.

              Motion-related signal changes are not removed by a variety of

               component analysis (ICA) for functional MRI (FMRI) data that
               allows for nonsquare mixing in the presence of Gaussian noise.
               In order to avoid overfitting, we employ objective estimation of
               the amount of Gaussian noise through Bayesian analysis of the
               true dimensionality of the data, i.e., the number of activation
               and non-Gaussian noise sources. This enables us to carry out
               probabilistic modeling and achieves an asymptotically unique
               decomposition of the data. It reduces problems of
               interpretation, as each final independent component is now much
               more likely to be due to only one physical or physiological
               process. We also describe other improvements to standard ICA,
               such as temporal prewhitening and variance normalization of
               timeseries, the latter being particularly useful in the context
               of dimensionality reduction when weak activation is present. We

               maps than field map-based unwarping, even when accounting for

              spurious findings and/or harm detection of true effects.
              Solutions have been proposed, including deleting ('scrubbing') or
              regressing out ('spike regression') motion volumes from fMRI
              time-series. These strategies remove motion-induced signal
              variations at the cost of destroying the autocorrelation
              structure of the fMRI time-series and reducing temporal degrees
              of freedom. ICA-based fMRI denoising strategies overcome these
              drawbacks but typically require re-training of a classifier,
              needing manual labeling of derived components (e.g. ICA-FIX;
              Salimi-Khorshidi et al. (2014)). Here, we propose an ICA-based
              strategy for Automatic Removal of Motion Artifacts (ICA-AROMA)
              that uses a small (n=4), but robust set of theoretically
              motivated temporal and spatial features. Our strategy does not
              require classifier re-training, retains the data's
              autocorrelation structure and largely preserves temporal degrees
              of freedom. We describe ICA-AROMA, its implementation, and
              initial validation. ICA-AROMA identified motion components with
              high accuracy and robustness as illustrated by leave-N-out
              cross-validation. We additionally validated ICA-AROMA in
              resting-state (100 participants) and task-based fMRI data (118
              participants). Our approach removed (motion-related) spurious
              noise from both rfMRI and task-based fMRI data to larger extent
              than regression using 24 motion parameters or spike regression.
              Furthermore, ICA-AROMA increased sensitivity to group-level
              activation. Our results show that ICA-AROMA effectively reduces
              motion-induced signal variations in fMRI data, is applicable
              across datasets without requiring classifier re-training, and
              preserves the temporal characteristics of the fMRI data.",

              corrective processing procedures have been applied, but the
              extent to which head motion distorts the data may be modulated by
              the corrective approach taken. We compare two different methods
              for estimating nuisance signals from tissues not expected to
              exhibit BOLD fMRI signals of neuronal origin: 1) the more
              commonly used mean signal method and 2) the principal components
              analysis approach (aCompCor: Behzadi et al., 2007). Further, we
              investigate the added benefit of ``scrubbing'' (Power et al.,
              2012) following both methods. We demonstrate that the use of
              aCompCor removes motion artifacts more effectively than

              variance in the global fMRI signal (the spatial mean of all
              signals in the brain) indexes subject arousal, and psychiatric
              conditions such as schizophrenia and autism have been
              characterized by differences in the global fMRI signal. Further,
              vigorous debates exist on whether global signals ought to be
              removed from fMRI data. However, surprisingly little research has
              focused on the empirical properties of whole-brain fMRI signals.
              Here we map the spatial and temporal properties of the global
              signal, individually, in 1000+ fMRI scans. Variance in the global
              fMRI signal is strongly linked to head motion, to hardware
              artifacts, and to respiratory patterns and their attendant
              physiologic changes. Many techniques used to prepare fMRI data
              for analysis fail to remove these uninteresting kinds of global
              signal fluctuations. Thus, many studies include, at the time of
              analysis, prominent global effects of yawns, breathing changes,
              and head motion, among other signals. Such artifacts will mimic
              dynamic neural activity and will spuriously alter signal
              covariance throughout the brain. Methods capable of isolating and
              removing global artifactual variance while preserving putative
              ``neural'' variance are needed; this paper adopts no position on
              the topic of global signal regression.",

  abstract = "Although it is being successfully implemented for exploration of
              the genome, discovery science has eluded the functional
              neuroimaging community. The core challenge remains the
              development of common paradigms for interrogating the myriad
              functional systems in the brain without the constraints of a
              priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI)
              constitutes a candidate approach capable of addressing this
              challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals large-amplitude
              spontaneous low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the fMRI
              signal that are temporally correlated across functionally related
              areas. Referred to as functional connectivity, these correlations
              yield detailed maps of complex neural systems, collectively
              constituting an individual's ``functional connectome.''
              Reproducibility across datasets and individuals suggests the
              functional connectome has a common architecture, yet each
              individual's functional connectome exhibits unique features, with
              stable, meaningful interindividual differences in connectivity
              patterns and strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional
              connectome, and its subsequent exploitation to discern genetic
              influences and brain-behavior relationships, will require
              multicenter collaborative datasets. Here we initiate this
              endeavor by gathering R-fMRI data from 1,414 volunteers collected
              independently at 35 international centers. We demonstrate a
              universal architecture of positive and negative functional
              connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual
              variability. Age and sex emerged as significant determinants.
              These results demonstrate that independent R-fMRI datasets can be
              aggregated and shared. High-throughput R-fMRI can provide
              quantitative phenotypes for molecular genetic studies and
              biomarkers of developmental and pathological processes in the
              brain. To initiate discovery science of brain function, the 1000
              Functional Connectomes Project dataset is freely accessible at

  abstract  = "The use of resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) in translational
               research is a powerful tool to assess brain connectivity and
               investigate neuropathology in mouse models. However, despite
               encouraging initial results, the characterization of consistent
               and robust resting state networks in mice remains a
               methodological challenge. One key reason is that the quality of
               the measured MR signal is degraded by the presence of structural
               noise from non-neural sources. Notably, in the current pipeline
               of the Human Connectome Project, a novel approach has been
               introduced to clean rs-fMRI data, which involves automatic
               artifact component classification and data cleaning (FIX). FIX
               does not require any external recordings of physiology or the
               segmentation of CSF and white matter. In this study, we
               evaluated the performance of FIX for analyzing mouse rs-fMRI
               data. Our results showed that FIX can be easily applied to mouse
               datasets and detects true signals with 100\% accuracy and true
               noise components with very high accuracy (>98\%), thus reducing
               both within- and between-subject variability of rs-fMRI
               connectivity measurements. Using this improved pre-processing
               pipeline, maps of 23 resting state circuits in mice were
               identified including two networks that displayed default mode
               network-like topography. Hierarchical clustering grouped these
               neural networks into meaningful larger functional circuits.
               These mouse resting state networks, which are publicly
               available, might serve as a reference for future work using
               mouse models of neurological disorders.",

  abstract = "Here, we demonstrate that subject motion produces substantial
              changes in the timecourses of resting state functional
              connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) data despite compensatory spatial
              registration and regression of motion estimates from the data.
              These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation
              structures throughout the brain. Specifically, many long-distance
              correlations are decreased by subject motion, whereas many
              short-distance correlations are increased. These changes in
              rs-fcMRI correlations do not arise from, nor are they adequately
              countered by, some common functional connectivity processing
              steps. Two indices of data quality are proposed, and a simple
              method to reduce motion-related effects in rs-fcMRI analyses is
              demonstrated that should be flexibly implementable across a
              variety of software platforms. We demonstrate how application of
              this technique impacts our own data, modifying previous
              conclusions about brain development. These results suggest the
              need for greater care in dealing with subject motion, and the
              need to critically revisit previous rs-fcMRI work that may not
              have adequately controlled for effects of transient subject
              movements.",

  abstract = "Preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
              involves numerous steps to clean and standardize the data before
              statistical analysis. Generally, researchers create ad hoc
              preprocessing workflows for each dataset, building upon a large
              inventory of available tools. The complexity of these workflows
              has snowballed with rapid advances in acquisition and processing.
              We introduce fMRIPrep, an analysis-agnostic tool that addresses
              the challenge of robust and reproducible preprocessing for fMRI
              data. fMRIPrep automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to
              the idiosyncrasies of virtually any dataset, ensuring
              high-quality preprocessing without manual intervention. By
              introducing visual assessment checkpoints into an iterative
              integration framework for software testing, we show that fMRIPrep
              robustly produces high-quality results on a diverse fMRI data
              collection. Additionally, fMRIPrep introduces less uncontrolled
              spatial smoothness than observed with commonly used preprocessing
              tools. fMRIPrep equips neuroscientists with an easy-to-use and
